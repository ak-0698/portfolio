## Projects
### I-Permit
-Software Engineering project for the development of I Permit System.
-Developed Use Case, Class, Sequence, Deployment diagrams.
-Designing I-Permit system included the process of requesting the permit by business entities and handling these requests by a 3-tier environment. Different APIs are used to get the request information and payment processing.
-Contributed by identifying different entities during the design process, laying out the basic use case diagram and developing the payment handling code.
### WATIR (WEB APPLICATION TESTING IN RUBY)
-Using sample code and test cases, explored the features of WATIR. 
-WATIR with other testing tools and explored the multi-browser support functionality. 
-IDE used is Ruby Mine and language is Ruby.
### License Plate Recognition
-An application of computer vision and image processing technology that takes video of vehicles.
-The vehicle frames as input image and by extracting their number plate from whole vehicle image it displays the number plate information into text.
-Based on the retrieved text we get the details of the owner.
